## Setting Up the Bot for Local Use

First, create a discord application! If you already have, feel free to skip this bit! Keep in mind that the role permissions are set to a specific discord server, so you might need to change that!

## Creating a Discord Application

Step 1: Navigate to the [Discord Developer Website](https://discord.com/developers/applications). This is where all Discord bots and OAuth applications are are born.

Step 2: Create your first Application Click Create an Application Enter your Application's name under Name The description, and app icon can be ignored for now and edited later.

The app icon will be the avatar for your bot, whilst Name will be the username for your bot.

Then hit the Big Blurple Save Changes Button at the bottom. This will build your application and bring you to its page.

## Setting Up Bot Accounts

When on your application information page click on the Bots section under Settings

## Creating the Bot

Hit that lovely Add Bot button, again in Blurple. This will prompt you about the repercussions of creating a bot account, after reading this hit Yes, do it! You will see that your Bot Section has changed quite a bit with information about the user.

## Getting and using your Token

You will see Click to Reveal Token in your Bot Information Section, your Token is sensitive information and should NEVER be shared. If your token does get into somebody's hands who shouldn't have it click the Regenerate button, this will invalidate all prior tokens.
Press the copy button to copy your token, then enter the Bot.py file and scroll to the bottom, there you will see the word TOKEN, simply replace it with the token you have just copied! 

## Setting Up the Bot for Hosting with Heroku

Assuming that you already have a **Heroku Account** and the **Heroku CLI** installed, here are the commands you will have to do to start hosting it with Heroku! I am too lazy to write them out, so please navigate to this [tutorial](https://techwithtim.net/tutorials/discord-py/hosting-a-discord-bot-for-free/).

## Still Need Help?

If you need help using the Bot, simply @ it! If you need help hosting it, or changing the code, please DM **Coddo#3210** on **Discord**!
